            <h2>Experience:</h2>
            <p>
                I have gained experience in several languages over my time programming. Throughout my college career
                I hope to improve my skills and be more versatile in my abilities to program. Currently my experience
                has given me experience with object oriented programming, debugging, flow control, and data bases.
                These skills have been learned through practical projects working with teams and developing within a
                deadline to present. This year I will gain more experience in working with a team on a deadline in this
                year's Byte Jam. <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Projects">For more information about previous Projects click here!</a>
